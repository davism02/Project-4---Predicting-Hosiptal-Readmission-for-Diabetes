# Project-4---Predicting-Hosiptal-Readmission-for-Diabetes

**Data Cleaning**

- Kept onyl the interested fields (race, age, gender, weight, time_in_hospital, max_glu_serum, insulin, diabetesMed)
- Dropped invalid values (?)
- Converted readmitted column to binary values (reamitted in 30 day - Y/N)
- Created id columns for race, gender, age, weight for analyses
